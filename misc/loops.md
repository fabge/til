# loops and variable names

Loop indices should be single letter names, because you are using them in the same place and it stops them from clashing with other variables.

This idea comes from "Huffman encoding". Meaning compress things that you are **about to use again**, that you **use a lot** and that you **don't have to remember** into **less characters**.
