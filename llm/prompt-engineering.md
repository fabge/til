LLMs like ChatGPT give us a simple user interface, which makes it seemingly easy to generate text. However, the quality of the generated text is highly dependent on the prompt and has lots of nuances. This page is a collection of tips and tricks for prompt engineering.

> Sometimes you will bang your head on a prompt trying to get the model to output reliable results, but, no matter what you do, it just won’t work. This will frequently happen when the bot’s final output requires intermediate thinking, but you ask the bot only for the output and nothing else. [...]

If you want to improve your code, paste it into the prompt and ask e.g.:

- `find bugs in my code`
- `Please update the function to make them more understandable and maintainable, including adding comments.`
- `look at the following function. Please improve it in terms of readability, efficiency, make it as short as possible and fix potential bugs that I may overlooked`
