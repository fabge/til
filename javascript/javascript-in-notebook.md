# Write Javascript/Node in a notebook

I am a big fan of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks, they help me tremendously to prototype and test code.
In the past I was struggling to prototype and test code in Javascript/Node, because I was missing a Notebook environment and using the `node` REPL or debugger was not an equivalent replacement.

Luckily, there is a VSCode extension called [Node.js Notebooks (REPL)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lostfields.nodejs-repl) that allows you to write Javascript/Node in a notebook.  
Create a `.nbb` file and start writing your code. The nice thing is that top level await is supported, so you can write async code without having to wrap it in a function.
