### authentication and authorization

- Microsoft Entra ID doesn't use Kerberos authentication (compared to Active Directory Domain Services)
- instead, it uses HTTP and HTTPS protocols such as **SAML**, **WS-Federation**, and **OpenID Connect** for **authentication**
- and uses **OAuth** for **authorization**.

### user accounts

types of user accounts:

- cloud identity
- directory-synchronized identity
- guest user

## applications

application <-> service principal

Both represent applications in Microsoft Entra ID.
An object in the Application class contains an **application definition** and an object in the servicePrincipal class constitutes **its instance** in the current Microsoft Entra tenant. Separating these two sets of characteristics allows you to define an application in one tenant and **use it across multiple tenants** by creating a service principal object for this application in each tenant. Microsoft Entra ID creates the service principal object when you register the corresponding application in that Microsoft Entra tenant.

## arm

### resource groups

- resources can only exist in one resource group
- resource groups cannot be renamed
- resource groups can have resources of many different types (services)
- **resource groups can have resources from many different regions**

When creating a resource group, you need to provide a location for that resource group. The resource group stores metadata about the resources. Therefore, when you specify a location for the resource group, you're specifying where that metadata is stored.
-> **this is different from the location of the resources themselves**

## rbac

concepts:

- security principal: An object that represents something that requests access to resources. e.g. user, group, service principal, managed identity
- role definition: A set of permissions that lists the allowed operations. Azure RBAC comes with built-in role definitions, but you can also create your own custom role definitions. Some built-in role definitions: *Reader*, *Contributor*, *Owner*, *User Access Administrator*
- scope: The boundary for the requested *level* of access, or "how much" access is granted. Management group, subscription, resource group, resource
- role assignment: An assignment attaches a **role definition** to a **security principal** at a **particular scope**. Users can grant the access described in a role definition by creating (attaching) an assignment for the role. e.g. Assign the *User Access Administrator* role to an admin group scoped to a management group. e.g. Assign the *Contributor* role to a user scoped to a subscription

### scopes

examples:

- Scope a role as available for assignment in two subscriptions: `"/subscriptions/c276fc76-9cd4-44c9-99a7-4fd71546436e", "/subscriptions/e91d47c4-76f3-4271-a796-21b4ecfe3624"`
- Scope a role as available for assignment only in the Network resource group: `"/subscriptions/c276fc76-9cd4-44c9-99a7-4fd71546436e/resourceGroups/Network"`
- Scope a role as available for assignment for all requestors: `"/"`

### azure roles vs microsoft entra roles

three types of roles:

- Classic subscription administrator roles (legacy) (Account Administrator, Service Administrator, and Co-Administrator)
- Azure role-based access control (RBAC) roles
- Microsoft Entra administrator roles (e.g. Global admin, Application admin, and Application developer)

**Microsoft Entra admin roles** are used to manage resources in Microsoft Entra ID, such as users, groups, and domains. These roles are defined for the Microsoft Entra tenant at the root level of the configuration.

**Azure RBAC roles** provide more granular access management for Azure resources. These roles are defined for a requestor or resource and can be applied at multiple levels: the root, management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, or resources.

Fundamental azure rbac roles:

- *Owner*: The Owner role has full access to all resources, including the right to delegate access to others. The Service Administrator and Co-Administrators roles are assigned the Owner role at the subscription scope.
- *Contributor*: The Contributor role can create and manage all types of Azure resources. This role can't grant access to others.
- *Reader*: The Reader role can view existing Azure resources.
- *User Access Administrator*: The User Access Administrator role can manage user access to Azure resources.

## virtual networks

- network virtual appliances
- service endpoints
- network security groups
- private links

- private vs public ip addresses

### static ip addresses

- Virtual machine: NIC
- Load balancer: Front-end configuration
- VPN gateway: VPN gateway IP configuration
- Application gateway: Front-end configuration

| Feature         | Basic SKU                                      | Standard SKU                                      |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| IP assignment   | Static or Dynamic                              | Static                                            |
| Security        | Open by default                                | Secure by default, closed to inbound traffic      |
| Resources       | Network interfaces, VPN gateways, Application gateways, and internet-facing load balancers | Network interfaces or public standard load balancers |
| Redundancy      | Not zone redundant                             | Zone redundant by default                         |

### network security groups (NSGs)

can be associated to a subnet or a network interface

source: Identifies how the security rule controls **inbound** traffic. The value specifies a specific source IP address range that's allowed or denied. The source filter can be any resource, an IP address range, an application security group, or a default tag.

destination: Identifies how the security rule controls **outbound** traffic. The value specifies a specific destination IP address range that's allowed or denied. The destination filter value is similar to the source filter. The value can be any resource, an IP address range, an application security group, or a default tag.

service: Specifies the destination protocol and port range for the security rule. You can choose a predefined service like RDP or SSH or provide a custom port range. There are a large number of services to select from.

priority: Assigns the priority order value for the security rule. Rules are processed according to the priority order of all rules for a network security group, including a subnet and network interface. The lower the priority value, the higher priority for the rule.

### application security groups

Application security groups work in the same way as network security groups, but they provide an application-centric way of looking at your infrastructure. *You join your virtual machines to an application security group*.

azure network watcher #TODO

FQDN - fully qualified domain name

Azure Private DNS allows for private name resolution between Azure virtual networks. Azure public DNS provides DNS for public access, such as name resolution for a publicly accessible website. Azure-provided name resolution does not support user-defined domain names and only supports a single virtual network. A DNS server on a virtual machine can also be used to achieve the goal but involves much more administrative effort to implement and maintain than using Azure Private DNS.

NSG - destinations? #TODO

virtual network link #TODO

application security group #TODO
Application security groups allow you to group together the network interfaces from multiple virtual machines, and then use the group as the source or destination in an NSG rule. The network interfaces must be in the same virtual network.

availability set #TODO

azure load balancer, incl. SKU #TODO
Basic Azure Load Balancer supports deployment in a single availability zone. Basic Azure Load Balancer supports only Basic SKU public IP. Azure Standard Load Balancer is zone-redundant, but has a higher cost.

A network interface is used to connect a virtual machine to a subnet.

For virtual network peering, both virtual networks must have non-overlapping IP addresses.

You can use a network security group (NSG) to be assigned to a network interface. NSGs can be associated with subnets or individual virtual machine instances within that subnet. When an NSG is associated with a subnet, the access control list (ACL) rules apply to all virtual machine instances of that subnet.
