# Enterprise application

You can restrict access to apps or similiar by integrating with an enterprise application and adding users to the application.

There is another way which is not as obvious at first. If you go to the enterprise application -> `Properties` and set `Assignment required?` to `No`, all users in the tenant will be able to access the app.
