# safer alternative to git push --force

There is a safer alternative to `git push --force`.

Use `--force-with-lease` and `--force-if-includes` to restrict force pushes so that they donâ€™t unintentionally overwrite commits pushed by others.

```bash
git push --force-with-lease --force-if-includes
```
